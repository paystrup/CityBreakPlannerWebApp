## Concept: City Break Planner

The core product this project centers around has been given the name City Break Planner as a working title. The purpose of the product is to make it easier for tourists to discover what the city has to offer, and, in extension to this, plan what to do on the different days of their stay. The product is to be a web application that fetches from the GuideDenmark database. Here we have all sorts of data on i.e. attractions, activities, restaurants spread throughout Denmark and especially in the larger cities. The UI of the webapp must be designed with a user centered approach and in accordance with VisitDenmark brand identity and design guidelines. Design consistency across platforms is of great importance to VisitDenmark, due to the professionalism and trustworthiness it signals. We also believe that a simple, intuitive, and delightful user experience is a key component to the success of the product. This product would be of interest for tourists in a very wide range, both domestically and internationally, old and young, families as well as individuals, and in different languages. So the UI design of the product needs to be inclusive, and take these things into consideration.

## The product is not finished and is currently only not fully responsive. Please view as a mobile device.
